With the Heartbeat Monitor App you can measure your heartbeat by simply placing your finger on the screen of your mobile phone. After a few seconds, the app will show the result of your heartbeat: relaxed (green), normal (grey) or accelerated (orange). When your heart beats faster, the app uses different icons to indicate that it's time to relax by going for a walk, practicing yoga, meditating, drinking a cup of tea, sunbathing or listening to music.
